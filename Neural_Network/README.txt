Here we implement linear regression using Octave. 

The code here are from the exercise-1 of the coursera course Machine learning (stanford) by Andrew Ng

Here is the list of files:
   computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression
   gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent
   computeCostMulti.m - Cost function for multiple variables
   gradientDescentMulti.m - Gradient descent for multiple variables
   featureNormalize.m - Function to normalize features
